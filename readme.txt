This is a lightweight text host that I made within 10 minutes so me and a some
friends of mine could have a place to post our text without fear that it might
be changed by any website moderators. It's about as simple as a text host gets,
and it works. It's creative common zero, so do whatever you want with it, pals.

You might find an issue with names if your server gives you the ability to use
multiple file extensions, like '.php.txt', because it might allow users to run
malicious scripts.

Files and their purposes ~

        index.php  ~ Acts as a landing page.
        style.css  ~ Resizes index.php's paste box.
